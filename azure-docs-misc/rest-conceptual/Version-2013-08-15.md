# Version 2013-08-15
Version 2013-08-15 includes these changes:  
  
-   Per-minute metrics, as well as hourly metrics. Metrics can be configured via the [Set Blob Service Properties](../rest-conceptual/Set-Blob-Service-Properties.md), [Set Queue Service Properties](../rest-conceptual/Set-Queue-Service-Properties.md), and [Set Table Service Properties](../rest-conceptual/Set-Table-Service-Properties.md) operations. Hourly and minute metrics are also available for the secondary location, if read-access geo-redundant replication is enabled.  
  
-   JSON and OData V3 support for the table service. See [Setting the OData Data Service Version Headers](../rest-conceptual/Setting-the-OData-Data-Service-Version-Headers.md) and [Payload Format for Table Service Operations](../rest-conceptual/Payload-Format-for-Table-Service-Operations.md) for more information.  
  
-   Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) support for the Blob, Table and Queue services. See [CORS Support for the Storage Services](../rest-conceptual/Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing--CORS--Support-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md) for details. CORS can be configured via the [Set Blob Service Properties](../rest-conceptual/Set-Blob-Service-Properties.md), [Set Queue Service Properties](../rest-conceptual/Set-Queue-Service-Properties.md), and [Set Table Service Properties](../rest-conceptual/Set-Table-Service-Properties.md) operations. To issue the CORS preflight request, call the [Preflight Blob Request](../rest-conceptual/Preflight-Blob-Request.md), [Preflight Queue Request](../rest-conceptual/Preflight-Queue-Request.md), or [Preflight Table Request](../rest-conceptual/Preflight-Table-Request.md) operation.  
  
-   New operations for determining the status of the secondary location, if read-access geo-redundant replication is enabled. See the [Get Blob Service Stats](../rest-conceptual/Get-Blob-Service-Stats.md), [Get Queue Service Stats](../rest-conceptual/Get-Queue-Service-Stats.md), and [Get Table Service Stats](../rest-conceptual/Get-Table-Service-Stats.md) operations.  
  
-   Support for multiple conditional headers for [Get Blob](../rest-conceptual/Get-Blob.md) and [Get Blob Properties](../rest-conceptual/Get-Blob-Properties.md). See [Specifying Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](../rest-conceptual/Specifying-Conditional-Headers-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md) for details.  
  
-   Support for overriding stored blob properties via query parameters on a shared access signature. See [Constructing a Service SAS](../rest-conceptual/Constructing-a-Service-SAS.md) for details.  
  
-   It is now possible to delete an uncommitted blob. See [Delete Blob](../rest-conceptual/Delete-Blob.md) for details.  
  
-   The [Lease Blob](../rest-conceptual/Lease-Blob.md) and [Lease Container](../rest-conceptual/Lease-Container.md) operations now return `ETag` and `Last-Modified-Time` response headers.  
  
-   The Lease Container operation does not modify the container’s `ETag` and `Last-Modified-Time` values.  
  
-   [Put Blob](../rest-conceptual/Put-Blob.md), [Put Block List](../rest-conceptual/Put-Block-List.md), and [Copy Blob](../rest-conceptual/Copy-Blob.md) will fail with 412 (Precondition Failed) if a lease ID was specified but the blob did not previously exist.  
  
-   The authorization for the [Copy Blob](../rest-conceptual/Copy-Blob.md) operation allows the client to specify a shared access signature for the destination blob if the copy operation is occurring within the same account.  
  
-   The [Get Blob Properties](../rest-conceptual/Get-Blob-Properties.md) operation returns the `Accept-Ranges` header.  
  
-   [List Containers](../rest-conceptual/List-Containers2.md), [List Blobs](../rest-conceptual/List-Blobs.md), and [List Queues](../rest-conceptual/List-Queues1.md) no longer return the `URL` field in the enumeration response.  
  
-   The `Metrics` element specified for or returned by [Set Blob Service Properties](../rest-conceptual/Set-Blob-Service-Properties.md), [Get Blob Service Properties](../rest-conceptual/Get-Blob-Service-Properties.md), [Set Queue Service Properties](../rest-conceptual/Set-Queue-Service-Properties.md), [Get Queue Service Properties](../rest-conceptual/Get-Queue-Service-Properties.md), [Get Table Service Properties](../rest-conceptual/Get-Table-Service-Properties.md), and [Set Table Service Properties](../rest-conceptual/Set-Table-Service-Properties.md) in has been changed to `HourMetrics`.  
  
-   The names of some XML elements specified for [Set Blob Service Properties](../rest-conceptual/Set-Blob-Service-Properties.md), [Set Queue Service Properties](../rest-conceptual/Set-Queue-Service-Properties.md), and [Set Table Service Properties](../rest-conceptual/Set-Table-Service-Properties.md) have been changed, and many settings are now optional.  
  
-   The names of the tables where Storage Analytics transactions are stored have been changed. See [About Storage Analytics Metrics](../rest-conceptual/About-Storage-Analytics-Metrics.md) for details.  
  
-   The Table service now supports the ODATA `Prefer` header, which enables control over the content echo in the response body for the [Create Table](../rest-conceptual/Create-Table.md) and [Insert Entity](../rest-conceptual/Insert-Entity.md) operations.  
  
-   Beginning with version 2013-08-15, a shared access signature will no longer collapse "//" to "/" as part of the URL which allows creation and reading of blobs starting with "/". Note that "//" is no longer allowed anymore as part of the container name portion of the URL.  
  
-   Beginning with version 2013-08-15, calling the [Get Blob](../rest-conceptual/Get-Blob.md) operation on a blob of size zero bytes with the `range` or `x-ms-range` header specified returns HTTP status code 416 (Requested Range Not Satisfiable). This change is HTTP compliant. In previous versions, this operation returned HTTP status code 206 (Partial Content).

# File Service REST API
The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is the preferred file share protocol used on premise today. The Microsoft Azure File service enables customers to leverage the availability and scalability of Azure’s Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) SMB without having to rewrite SMB client applications.  
  
 The Azure File service also offers a compelling alternative to traditional Direct Attached Storage (DAS) and Storage Area Network (SAN) solutions, which are often complex and expensive to install, configure, and operate. Pricing for the new Azure File service is consistent with existing Azure Storage services and is charged in units of storage capacity and transactions. See the [Azure Storage Pricing page](https://www.windowsazure.com/pricing/details/) for details.  
  
 Files stored in Azure File service shares are accessible via the SMB protocol, and also via REST APIs, at the endpoint `http|https://<account>.file.core.window.net`. Note that HTTPS is recommended.  
  
 While the Azure File service REST APIs are similar to the Azure Blob service REST APIs, there are minor differences related to how the service models the underlying file system. These differences are noted in the operations table below.  
  
## Azure File Service REST Operations  
 The Azure File service offers the following four resources: the storage account, shares, directories, and files. Shares provide a way to organize sets of files and also can be mounted as an SMB file share that is hosted in the cloud.  
  
 The File service REST API provides a way to work with share, directory, and file resources via HTTP/HTTPS operations. File service operations are available only in version 2014-02-14 of the storage services or later.  
  
 The File service REST API includes the operations listed in the table below.

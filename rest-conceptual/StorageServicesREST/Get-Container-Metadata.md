# Get Container Metadata
The `Get Container Metadata` operation returns all user-defined metadata for the container.  
  
## Request  
 The `Get Container Metadata` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended. Replace *myaccount* with the name of your storage account:  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|`GET/HEAD`|`https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer?restype=container&comp=metadata`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
### Emulated Storage Service URI  
 When making a request against the emulated storage service, specify the emulator hostname and Blob service port as `127.0.0.1:10000`, followed by the emulated storage account name:  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|`GET/HEAD`|`http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1/mycontainer?restype=container&comp=metadata`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
 For more information, see [Using the Azure Storage Emulator for Development and Testing](assetId:///f0e3acde-f019-4148-9544-34cf2ff27211).  
  
### URI Parameters  
 The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`timeout`|Optional. The `timeout` parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see [Setting Timeouts for Blob Service Operations](../StorageServicesREST/Setting-Timeouts-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md).|  
  
### Request Headers  
 The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Authorization`|Required. Specifies the authentication scheme, account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authentication for the Azure Storage Services](../StorageServicesREST/Authentication-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authentication for the Azure Storage Services](../StorageServicesREST/Authentication-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`x-ms-lease-id: <ID>`|Optional, version 2012-02-12 and newer. If specified, `Get Container Metadata` only succeeds if the container’s lease is active and matches this ID. If there is no active lease or the ID does not match, error code 412 (`Precondition Failed`) is returned.|  
|`x-ms-version`|Required for all authenticated requests, optional for anonymous requests. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](../StorageServicesREST/Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1 KB character limit that is recorded in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled. Using this header is highly recommended for correlating client-side activities with requests received by the server. For more information, see [About Storage Analytics Logging](../StorageServicesREST/About-Storage-Analytics-Logging.md) and [Azure Logging: Using Logs to Track Storage Requests](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/08/03/windows-azure-storage-logging-using-logs-to-track-storage-requests.aspx).|  
  
### Request Body  
 None.  
  
## Response  
 The response includes an HTTP status code and a set of response headers.  
  
### Status Code  
 A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK).  
  
 For information about status codes, see [Status and Error Codes](../StorageServicesREST/Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).  
  
### Response Headers  
 The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response may also include additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the [HTTP/1.1 protocol specification](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=150478).  
  
|Syntax|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`x-ms-meta-name:value`|Returns a string containing a name-value pair associated with the container as metadata.|  
|`ETag`|The entity tag for the container. If the request version is 2011-08-18 or newer, the ETag value will be in quotes.|  
|`Last-Modified`|Returns the date and time the container was last modified. The date format follows RFC 1123. For more information, see [Representation of Date-Time Values in Headers](../StorageServicesREST/Representation-of-Date-Time-Values-in-Headers.md).<br /><br /> Any operation that modifies the container or its properties or metadata updates the last modified time. Operations on blobs do not affect the last modified time of the container.|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see [Troubleshooting API Operations](../StorageServicesREST/Troubleshooting-API-Operations.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Indicates the version of the Blob service used to execute the request. This header is returned for requests made against version 2009-09-19 and above.<br /><br /> This header is also returned for anonymous requests without a version specified if the container was marked for public access using the 2009-09-19 version of the Blob service.|  
|`Date`|A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated.|  
  
### Response Body

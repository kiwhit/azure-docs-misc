 For information about status codes, see [Status and Error Codes](../StorageServicesREST/Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).  
  
### Response Headers  
 The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response may also include additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the [HTTP/1.1 protocol specification](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=73147).  
  
|Response header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see [Troubleshooting API Operations](../StorageServicesREST/Troubleshooting-API-Operations.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Indicates the version of the File service used to execute the request.|  
|`Date`|A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated.|  
  
### Response Body  
 None.  
  
### Sample Response  
  
```  
Response Status:  
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted  
  
Response Headers:  
Transfer-Encoding: chunked  
Content-Type: application/xml  
Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2014 21:45:00 GMT  
x-ms-version: 2014-02-14  
Server: Windows-Azure-File/1.0 Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0  
```  
  
## Authorization  
 Only the account owner may call this operation.  
  
## Remarks  
 Attempting to delete directories that are not empty will fail with status code 412 (Precondition Failed), with the service returning additional error information indicating that the directory is not empty.  
  
 Once a client has received status code 202 (Accepted), then the directory has been removed from the system and is eligible to be recreated. Subsequent calls to [Get Directory Properties](../StorageServicesREST/Get-Directory-Properties.md) will result in 404 (Not Found).

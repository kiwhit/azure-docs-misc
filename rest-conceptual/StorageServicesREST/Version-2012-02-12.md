# Version 2012-02-12
The 2012-02-12 version of the Azure storage services includes these changes:  
  
-   [Copy Blob](../StorageServicesREST/Copy-Blob.md) now works asynchronously, and can copy from any Azure storage account.  
  
-   Containers can be leased, and all leases support shorter or infinite durations. You must now provide a lease duration.  
  
-   A released lease cannot be broken or renewed. Previously these operations were allowed.  
  
-   If you break a lease that is breaking or already broken, no error will occur.  
  
-   The lease ID of an active lease can be changed.  
  
-   A lease ID can be included on an operation to acquire a lease.  
  
-   When breaking a lease, you can specify a period during which the lease should remain active.  
  
-   Table and Queue services now support shared access signatures.  
  
-   A shared access signature can live longer than an hour, even with no stored access policy.  
  
-   The Blob service now provides MD5 hashes for the [Put Blob](../StorageServicesREST/Put-Blob.md) operation.

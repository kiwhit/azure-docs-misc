 For information about status codes, see [Status and Error Codes](../StorageServicesREST/Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).  
  
## Response Headers  
 The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response may also include additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the [HTTP/1.1 protocol specification](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=73147).  
  
|Response header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see [Troubleshooting API Operations](../StorageServicesREST/Troubleshooting-API-Operations.md).|

## Remarks  
 When a share is deleted, a share with the same name cannot be recreated for at least 30 seconds. While the share is being deleted, attempts to recreate a share of the same name will fail with status code 409 (Conflict), with the service returning additional error information indicating that the share is being deleted. All other operations, including operations on any files under the share, will fail with status code 404 (Not Found) while the share is being deleted.

# Version 2009-07-17
The 2009-07-17 version of the Azure storage services includes these changes:  
  
-   A root or default container that permits blobs to reside at the top level of the storage account hierarchy. See [Working with the Root Container](../StorageServicesREST/Working-with-the-Root-Container.md) for more information.  
  
-   Enhancements to the [Put Block List](../StorageServicesREST/Put-Block-List.md) operation for updating blobs.  
  
-   Delegated access to containers and blobs, via shared access signatures and container-level access policies. See [Manage Access to Azure Storage Resources](assetId:///c30f3d25-67a0-47b4-a05e-afee4126c7c8) for more information.  
  
-   Thirty-second server timeouts for the [List Containers](../StorageServicesREST/List-Containers2.md), [List Blobs](../StorageServicesREST/List-Blobs.md), [List Queues](../StorageServicesREST/List-Queues1.md), [Query Tables](../StorageServicesREST/Query-Tables.md), and [Query Entities](../StorageServicesREST/Query-Entities.md) operations.  
  
-   A request against the Blob service may specify only a single conditional header. If a request specifies both the `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers, the request is evaluated based on the criteria specified in `If-None-Match`. If a request specifies both the `If-Match` and `If-Unmodified-Since` headers, the request is evaluated based on the criteria specified in `If-Match`. See [Specifying Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](../StorageServicesREST/Specifying-Conditional-Headers-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md) for more information.

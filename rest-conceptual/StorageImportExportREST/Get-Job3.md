# Get Job3
The `Get Job` operation gets information about an existing job from the Windows Azure Import/Export service.  
  
## Request  
 The `Get Job` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is required. Replace `<subscription-id>` with your subscription ID, `<storage-account-name>` with the name of your storage account, and `<job-name>` with the name of your import job or export job:  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|GET&#124;HEAD|`https://management.core.windows.net/<subscription-id>/services/importexport/storageaccounts/<storage-account-name/jobs/<job-name>[?$format=format]`|  
  
### URI Parameters  
 The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`format`|**Optional.** Can be used to override the `Accept` request header. See the `Accept` header for additional information.<br /><br /> The following is an example of the `$format` query parameter:<br /><br /> `$format=application/json;odata=minimalmetadata`|  
  
### Request Headers  
 The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Accept`|**Optional.** If specified, it must be `application/json` (which specifies the JSON Light format). Other values will result in response code 406 (`Not Acceptable`).<br /><br /> One of the following parameters can also be included:<br /><br /> `odata=minimalmetadata`<br /><br /> `odata=nometatadata`<br /><br /> `odata=fullmetadata`<br /><br /> The default parameter is `odata=minimalmetadata`.<br /><br /> The following is an example header:<br /><br /> `Accept: application/json;odata=minimalmetadata`|  
|`Accept-Language`|**Optional.** Currently only the values `en` and `en-us` are supported.|  
|`Content-Length`|**Optional.** If this header is specified, the value must be set to `0`.|  
|`x-ms-date`|**Optional.** If specified, the value should specify the date and time when the request is sent, in RFC 1123 format.|  
|`x-ms-version`|**Required.** Specifies the service management version to use for this request. The value of this header must be set to `2014-05-01` or `2014-11-01`.|  
|`If-Modified-Since`|**Optional.** A DateTime value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource has been modified since the specified time.|  
|`If-Unmodified-Since`|**Optional.** A DateTime value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource has not been modified since the specified date/time.|  
|`If-Match`|**Optional.** An ETag value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource's ETag matches the value specified.|  
|`If-None-Match`|**Optional.** An ETag value, or the wildcard character (*). Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource's ETag does not match the value specified.<br /><br /> Specify the wildcard character (\*) to perform the operation only if the resource does not exist, and fail the operation if it does exist.|  
  
### Request Body  
 None.  
  
## Response  
 The response includes an HTTP status code, a set of response headers, and a response body in XML format.  
  
### Status Code  
 A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK).  
  
### Response Headers  
 The response for this operation includes the following headers.  
  
|Response Header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|`Content-Encoding`|The value of this header will always be `identity`.|  
|`Content-Length`|The length of the content returned in the response. If the response body is chunked, this header is not included.|  
|`Content-Type`|Specifies the format in which the results are returned. The value of this header will always be `application/json`.|  
|`Date`|A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated.|  
|`ETag`|Contains a value that the client can use to perform conditional operations by using the `If-Match` or `If-None-Match` request headers.|  
|`Last-Modified`|The date/time that the job was last modified. The date format follows RFC 1123. For more information, see [Representation of Date-Time Values in Headers](../Topic/Representation%20of%20Date-Time%20Values%20in%20Headers.md).|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|A value that uniquely identifies a request made against the Import/Export service.|  
|`x-ms-version`|Indicates the version of the Import/Export service used to execute the request.|

```  
  
## Remarks  
 The `Get Job` operation returns the overall status of a job, including the status of the job and of each drive comprising the job.  
  
 All properties noted as optional in the request body of the [Put Job](../StorageImportExportREST/Put-Job.md) operation will be returned by the `Get Job` operation only if they have been specified as part of the `Put Job` request.  
  
 The response for the `Get Job` operation includes basic information such as job name, storage account name, type, description, and job state. In addition, depending on the type and state of the job, the response may also include other information, such as shipping and return information for drives and BitLocker keys for export jobs.  
  
 The verbose log is a blob that contains the complete copy log for a drive. It can be used to determine the copy status of each file on a drive and to view any warnings or errors that were logged during the copy operation. See [Import-Export Service Log File Format](../StorageImportExportREST/Import-Export-Service-Log-File-Format.md) for its format.  
  
 By default, the verbose log is not generated. To enable it, set `EnableVerboseLog` to `true` in a call to `Put Job` or [Update Job Properties](../StorageImportExportREST/Update-Job-Properties.md).  
  
 The error log is a subset of the verbose log. It contains only warning and error entries. The error log is always enabled.  
  
 Both the error logs and verbose logs (if enabled) are stored in the container specified by the `ImportExportStatesPath` element. If no container is specified, the logs are stored in a default container named *waimportexport*. Logs are stored as block blobs with the following naming convention: `waies/jobname_driveid_timestamp_logtype.xml`.  
  
 You can specify conditional headers to retrieve a job only when certain conditions are met. When specifying conditional headers, keep in mind the following:  
  
-   If a request specifies both the `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers, the request is evaluated based on the criteria specified in `If-None-Match`.  
  
-   If a request specifies both the `If-Match` and `If-Unmodified-Since` headers, the request is evaluated based on the criteria specified in `If-Match`.  
  
-   With the exception of the two combinations of conditional headers listed above, a request may specify only a single conditional header. Specifying more than one conditional header results in status code 400 (`Bad Request`).  
  
 The following table indicates the response codes returned for an unmet condition for each conditional header:  
  
|Conditional header|Response code if condition has not been met|  
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|  
|`If-Modified-Since`|Precondition Failed (412)|  
|`If-Unmodified-Since`|Precondition Failed (412)|  
|`If-Match`|Precondition Failed (412)|  
|`If-None-Match`|Precondition Failed (412)|

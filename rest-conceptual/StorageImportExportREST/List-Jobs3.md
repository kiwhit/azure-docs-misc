# List Jobs3
The `List Jobs` operation lists active and completed jobs for a storage account in a subscription.  
  
## Request  
 The `List Jobs` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is required. Replace `<subscription-id>` with your subscription ID , and `<storage-account-name>` with the name of your storage account:  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|GET|`https://management.core.windows.net/subscription-id/services/importexport/storageaccounts/storage-account-name/jobs[?type=type&from=from&to=to&states=states][&$skiptoken=skiptoken][&$top=top][&$format=format]`|  
  
### URI Parameters  
 The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`type`|Optional. Specifies that only jobs of the specified type should be returned. Value may be `import` or `export`.|  
|`from`|Optional. Specifies that only jobs created at the specified time or later should be returned. Value must be a `DateTime` value specified in UTC format; see [Formatting DateTime Property Values](../Topic/Formatting%20DateTime%20Property%20Values.md) for details.|  
|`to`|Optional. Specifies that only jobs created at the specified time or earlier should be returned. Value must be a `DateTime` value specified in UTC format; see [Formatting DateTime Property Values](../Topic/Formatting%20DateTime%20Property%20Values.md) for details.|  
|`states`|Optional. Specifies that only jobs whose state matches the specified value should be returned. Valid values are `Creating`, `Shipping`, `Transferring`, `Packaging`, and `Completed`. Values are case-sensitive. To specify multiple states, separate values with a comma, without spaces.|  
|`skiptoken`|Optional. A string value that identifies the portion of the results to be returned with the next list operation.<br /><br /> Very rarely, a `List Jobs` operation may not return the complete set of results because there are too many jobs. In this case, a URI that includes a `$skiptoken` query parameter will be returned in the `odata.nextlink` property in the response. This URI can then be used in a subsequent call to request the next set of the results. The `$skiptoken` query parameter is opaque to the client.|  
|`top`|Optional. An integer value that specifies how many jobs should be returned.|  
|`format`|Optional. Can be used to override the `Accept` request header. See the `Accept` header for additional information.<br /><br /> The following is an example of the `$format` query parameter:<br /><br /> `$format=application/json;odata=minimalmetadata`|  
  
### Request Headers  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Accept`|**Optional.** If specified, it must be `application/json` (which specifies the JSON Light format). Other values will result in response code 406 (`Not Acceptable`).<br /><br /> One of the following parameters can also be included:<br /><br /> `odata=minimalmetadata`<br /><br /> `odata=nometatadata`<br /><br /> `odata=fullmetadata`<br /><br /> The default parameter is `odata=minimalmetadata`.<br /><br /> The following is an example header:<br /><br /> `Accept: application/json;odata=minimalmetadata`|  
|`Accept-Language`|**Optional.** Currently only the values `en` and `en-us` are supported.|  
|`x-ms-date`|**Optional.** If specified, the value should specify the date and time when the request is sent, in the RFC 1123 format.|  
|`x-ms-version`|**Required.** Specifies the service management version to use for this request. The value of this header must be set to `2014-05-01` or `2014-11-01`.|  
  
### Request Body  
 None.  
  
## Response  
 The response includes an HTTP status code, a set of response headers, and a response body in XML format.  
  
### Status Code  
 A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK).

 The response for this operation includes the following headers.  
  
|Response Header|Description|

|`Content-Encoding`|The value of this header will always be `identity`.|  
|`Content-Length`|The length of the content returned in the response. If the response body is chunked, this header is not included.|  
|`Content-Type`|Specifies the format in which the results are returned. The value of this header will always be `application/json`.|  
|`Date`|A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated.|
